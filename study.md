# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
A SPA is a Single Page Application. Meaning the whole applications runs on one url.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Page is used to refer to a webpage. To a certain view. If you click on a tab and then the browsers leads you to a different section e.g. "How to contact company Y", this is considered a page inside of the webpage.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

The ASP.NET page framework is a scalable programming model that you can use on the server to dynamically generate Web pages.
View state is the method that the ASP.NET page framework uses to preserve page and control values between round trips. When the HTML markup for the page is rendered, the current state of the page and values that must be retained during postback are serialized into base64-encoded strings.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

- A SPA doesnt need to reload the entire page everytime the client communiacates with the server
--> leads to a more fluid and more responsive application
- server and client are working independent
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?
